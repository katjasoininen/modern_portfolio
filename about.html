                <p> I am an easily excited healthcare digitalization 
                professional who seeks new experiences. 
                I have had the opportunity to continuously

                the best results cannot be achieved. Therefore, 
                learning and growth together are the foundation 
                of success in healthcare digitalization.</p>
